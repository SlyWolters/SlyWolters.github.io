				<h4>Welcome to my Webbpage!</h4>
<p>
My Name is Sly Wolters, a 24 year old sewing wizard and creative problem-solver with a knack for making things look good. ðŸ§µâœ¨ <br>
Based in Gothenburg Sweden, you can usually find me juggling fabrics and creating magic in the costume world.
If you want to peek into my latest sewing adventures, head over to my Instagram â€“ it's a visual feast of my latest craftsmanship!
<br><br>
In my world, I've worn many hats (literally and figuratively). From being in charge of the costume department at GrÃ¶na Lund, to weaving my costume magic at the Royal Swedish Ballet School, my experiences have been incredibly diverse. The multifaceted nature of my work extends beyond sewing, encompassing various roles and creative endeavors that have enriched my professional journey."
Not just a sewing virtuoso, I've ventured into the world of performance too. At Liseberg, I've donned my acting hat, building characters, spreading joy, and setting the stage on fire during the Halloween season. 
And lets not forget my stint as a Zombie, Clown, and even a Bridezilla at GrÃ¶na Lund â€“ complete with the art of self-applied spooky makeup!
<br><br>
Education-wise, I currently pursue pattern construction and sewing at TillskÃ¤rarakademin in Gothenburg. Supplementing my formal education ar HÃ¶gskolan i BorÃ¥s, I've engaged in multiple specialized courses, ranging from Sashiko Japanese Embroidery, to letherwork and Burlesque Costuming. Continuous learning is integral to my professional ethos.
<br><br>
Throughout my career, I've seamlessly blended artistic expression with organizational acumen. Whether safeguarding costumes during Kulturama's production of Annie or providing theatrical assistance with Charlotta Grudin, my commitment to excellence remains unwavering.
For those seeking a professional with a penchant for creativity and an eye for detail, I invite you to connect. Let's collaborate and elevate your next project into a true masterpiece!
