        <h2>About Me</h2>

		<h3>option 1</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my Webbpage! 
MY Name is Sly Wolters, a sewing wizard and creative problem-solver with a knack for making things look good. ðŸ§µâœ¨ Based in GÃ¶teborg Sweeden, you can usually find me juggling fabrics and creating magic in the costume world.
If you want to peek into my latest sewing adventures, head over to my Instagram â€“ it's a visual feast of my latest craftsmanship!
In my world, I've worn many hats (literally and figuratively). From being the Costume Commander at GrÃ¶na Lund, where I orchestrated the costume chaos with a smile, to weaving my costume magic at the Royal Swedish Ballet School â€“ I've seen it all.
Not just a sewing virtuoso, I've ventured into the world of performance too. At Liseberg, I've donned my acting hat, building characters, spreading joy, and setting the stage on fire during the Halloween season. And who could forget my stint as a Zombie, Clown, and even a Bridezilla at GrÃ¶na Lund â€“ complete with the art of self-applied spooky makeup!
Education-wise, I've honed my skills at the TillskÃ¤rarakademin in GÃ¶teborg, mastering the art of pattern construction with a touch of sewing sorcery. Not to forget my time at the Korrespondentsgymnasiet, where I delved into the mysteries of the economic world with a side of Juridik.
When I'm not sewing up a storm or enchanting audiences, you might catch me indulging my creative curiosity in various courses. From the artistry of Sashiko Japanskt Broderi to the secrets of Burlesque Costuming, I love adding new strings to my creative bow.
In the midst of all this, I've played roles offstage too â€“ from being the guardian of costumes during Annie at Kulturama to assisting in theatrical escapades with Charlotta Grudin. I've even dabbled in making Grinchen grin with some homemade costumes!
If you're curious and want to know more, or if you're in need of a creative mind with a flair for fabric, drop me a line. Let's turn your next project into a masterpiece!
